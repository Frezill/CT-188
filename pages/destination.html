                        the difference. As a rich landlord, you can enjoy fruit, hot tea and listen to music from a hand-operated gramophone 
                        made more than 300 years ago. As a farmer, you are given the opportunity to work and prepare meals as southern 
                        farmers did in the past.

                        This is a home to over 20 species of birds, 10 species of storks with the population standing at more than 10 thousand. 
                        It is one of the largest sanctuaries in the Mekong river Delta. In the past, the stork garden was a rice farm which is 
                        surrounded with mango trees, Bang Lang trees and the shade of coconut trees. In 1983, there were about 200 storks gathered 
                        around there and settled on his field. Because the owner is a nature-loving farmer, he did not annoy them to run away by 
                        any traps or poisons. On the contrary, he wanted to protect and help all of them such as: planting a lot of bamboo trees 
                        as a warm home for them. In 1994, numerous birds and species of storks from everywhere flock more and more. Top tip: This 
                        garden is still under control by the locals.

                        At first glance, Can Tho seems to be a bustling city, with a stream of commerce flowing continuously down the Hau River. But treat yourself 
                        to a room on its leafy banks, dine on its sun-ripened fruits and fresh river fish, glide on sampans through its sultry canals, and you’ll 
                        soon realise Can Tho’s big city facade is just half the story. The content half? Misty sunrises over the water, lazy afternoons swaying in a 
                        hammock, and balmy evenings announced by a chorus of insects. Under the Mekong Delta’s blazing blue skies, Can Tho leaves a vivid impression.

                        via the Hau River, on a cruise from Ho Chi Minh City or Cambodia. Once in town, local taxis are readily available. Cycling is also an option 
                        on the islets and roads leading away from the city. Local ferries run regularly between the mainland and islets.
